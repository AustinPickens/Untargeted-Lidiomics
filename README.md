In this manuscript: Pickens CA, Vasquez AI, Jones AD, Fenton JI. Obesity, adipokines, and C-peptide are associated with distinct plasma phospholipid profiles in adult males, an untargeted lipidomic approach. Nature Scientific Reports. 2017 Jul 24;7(1):6335. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-05785-0


We investigated associations between anthropometrics, adipokines, a glycemic marker, and cytokines, and data generated from profiling the plasma lipidome using non-selective multiplexed collision induced dissociation.

The clinical meta data for our population is located in the R object  "H".  The mean imputed internal standard normalized lipids which had <20% missing values is located in the R object "IS.mean".  The pareto scaled internal standard normalized mean imputed data set is located in the R object "pareto.IS".
