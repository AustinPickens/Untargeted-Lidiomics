In this manuscript, we investigated associations between anthropometrics, adipokines, a glycemic marker, and cytokines, and data generated from profiling the plasma lipidome using non-selective multiplexed collision induced dissociation.

The clinical meta data for our population is located in the R object  "H".  The mean imputed internal standard normalized lipids which had <20% missing values is located in the R object "IS.mean".  The pareto scaled internal standard normalized mean imputed data set is located in the R object "pareto.IS".
