 ### Creating a directory to store file outputs from BGLR ###
 dir.create("BMI"); setwd("BMI")
 getwd() # Verify working directory 

 ### Setting response, lipidomic data, iterations, and burn in  ###
 X=pareto.IS # 1,745 pareto scaled lipidomic data
 y<-H$BMI # Response: body mass index values for each respective patient
 nIter=200000 # Long Markov Chain of 200,000 iterations
 burnIn=50000 # Number of iterations to discard for burn in
 
     ## Computing the metabolomic similarity matrix ##
     L<-sum(apply(X=X,FUN=var,MARGIN=2))
     G<-tcrossprod(X)/L 
      # The G matrix is an nxn matrix of distances to measure similarities
        # between participants with respect to their lipid profiles
     
     ##  RKHS model parameters  ## 
      # ETA #
      ETA.FixMet=list(Met=list(K=G,model="RKHS"), # The G matrix represents the lipidome, 
                      # and the RKHS kernel is specified
        Fix=list(~H$age+factor(H$smoking), model="FIXED")) # The fixed effects of the model are age and smoking
     
     ## RKHS regression ##
     fmGBLUP<-BGLR(y=y,ETA=ETA.FixMet, nIter=nIter, burnIn=burnIn, saveAt="GBLUP_")
        # RKHS model is: BMI = fixed effects + lipidomic data
     
 ### Variance of Best Linear Unbiased Predictor (BLUP) and variance of error ###
   # inference was done based on one of every 5 samples of the last 150,000
    # therefore, since the burn in was 50,000 we need to remove the first 10,000 samples
 list.files()
 VarU=scan("GBLUP_ETA_Met_varU.dat") #load in variance of the lipidome BLUP model (varU). Total of 30,000 	# lines.
 VarU=VarU[-c(1:10000)] # remove the burn in iterations from varU
 VarE=scan("GBLUP_varE.dat") # load in variance of the error (varE). Total of 30,000 lines.
 VarE=VarE[-c(1:10000)] #remove the burn in iterations varE
     
   ## Calculating percent of the inter-individual differences in response variables that can be 
     # attributed to lipidome profiles ##
     tmp=(VarU/(VarU+VarE))*100 # Calculate % varU as sum of varU + varE
     round(quantile(tmp, probs = c(0.05, 0.95)),0) # Determine 95% confidence intervals
     
###### The other responses were run similarly by creating individual directories for each response and modifying 
	# the y<- for each individual response  #######
